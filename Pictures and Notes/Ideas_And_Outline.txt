Input: Initial conditions file of form:

x    y    material    density    ux    uy    material properties...    external forces

Initially "Material" will just be a 0 or 1 for fluid or walls. That should be expanded on in the future to include real-world materials which would use "material properties" to affect the simulation in some way. 

"external forces" would refer to the constant forcing terms driving the system. In Pouseille flow this can be a additive constant applied to all fluid elements. In a thermoacoustic engine this is the constant temperature gradient maintained on the ends of the heat exchangers.
