# Fluid_Simulation
This chronicles my attempts at building a general simulation engine for fluid dynamics based on the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. I have currently implemented a 2-dimensional MacCormack method scheme for the simple Poiseuille flow problem.

Live rendering is created using a simple OpenGL implementation.
